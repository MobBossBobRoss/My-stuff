# My-stuff
A dumping ground for whatever things my hands type up.

charmover.py: A program that identifies and moves MUGEN files from a user-designated folder, to a user-designated MUGEN installation's char and stage folders. It can also delete the leftover files, and make sure any .mp3 or .ogg files that are included with the stages are moved to the proper \sounds folder, check if the contents of an extracted archive are loose files or not, and if they are, it creates a new folder named after the archive and places those loose files into it.

EternalGauntlet.py: A game where the player is a hero with random equipment. They must fight a monster that will drop items that the player can use. After each monster is defeated the player will be able to equip or unequip the items in their inventory. The game will end when the player's hp is 0 or less. I've finished the basics of it, and I think i'll just leave it how it is. I only wanted to prove to myself I could make an equipment-based battle system in python.
