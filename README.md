# My-stuff
A dumping ground for whatever things my hands type up.

charmover.py: A very niche program that moves and/or extracts files from my designated MUGEN char and stage download folders, to my MUGEN installation's char and stage folders. It can also delete the leftover files, and make sure any .mp3 or .ogg files that are included with the stages are moved to the proper \sounds folder.

EternalGauntlet.py: Will be a game where the player is a hero with random equipment. They must fight a monster that will drop items that the player can use. After each monster is defeated the player will be able to equip or unequip the items in their inventory. The game will end when the player's hp is 0 or less.
