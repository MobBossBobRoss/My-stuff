# My-stuff
A dumping ground for whatever things my hands type up.

charmover: A very niche program that moves and/or extracts files from my designated MUGEN char and stage download folders, to my MUGEN installation's char and stage folders. It can also delete the leftover files, and make sure any .mp3 or .ogg files that are included with the stages are moved to the proper /sounds folder.
